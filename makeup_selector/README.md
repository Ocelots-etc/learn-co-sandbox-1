# MakeupSelector

The Makeup Selector CLI app is designed to provide easy access to a wide array of cosmetics to allow you to find new products to try. First, you can select a makeup category (blush, eyeshadow, etc.), then you can filter that item by entering a brand, selecting top rated products, or choosing a price range category.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'makeup_selector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install makeup_selector
